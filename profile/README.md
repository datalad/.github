# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to DataLad!

DataLad is a free and open source distributed data management system that keeps track of your data, creates structure, ensures reproducibility, supports collaboration, and integrates with widely used data infrastructure.

Building on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/), DataLad allows you to version control arbitrarily large files in datasets, without the need for custom data structures, central infrastructure, or third party services.
